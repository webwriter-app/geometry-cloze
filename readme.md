# WebWriter Geometry Cloze Widget

This repo contains a widget written in Lit that implements an editor for geometry cloze style exercises. It is espacially designed to be used in the [WebWriter software](https://webwriter.app/). \
This widget was created as part of the bachelor thesis of [Florin Gro√üe](https://der-grosse.de) titled "Implementation of a widget for geometry exercises".

To install all depedencies use the [pnpm package manager](https://pnpm.io/installation).

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

## Preview / Usage
